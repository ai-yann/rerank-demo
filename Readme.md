# Rerank vs Lexical Search Demo (Retail Banking)
The purpose is to compare BM25 against a hybrid of BM25 *and* Cohere Rerank 3, to sell Cohere Rerank 3 to a retail banking company.

I want the UI to clearly demonstrate how Rerank 3 improves the ranking.

I want to take out the command-r-plus generated evaluation (both removing the stars and the explanation comparing the two results). I also want to remove the relevance scores from BM25 and Rerank. Instead I just want to show them side by side, 3 results from each, because I can talk through the comparison.
